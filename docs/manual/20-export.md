# Export

The Export view turns your book into a file you can send to a beta reader, an editor, or a publisher. Eight formats are built in: EPUB, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, Final Draft, LaTeX, Codex Markdown, and Codex PDF.

## Opening Export

In the activity bar, click **Export** in the **Publish** group.

## The export form

- **Format** — drop-down of the available formats:
  - **EPUB (e-book)**
  - **DOCX (Word)**
  - **PDF**
  - **Markdown**
  - **Final Draft (.fdx)**
  - **LaTeX**
  - **Codex (Markdown)** — your codex entries as a Markdown world bible, with images written to a folder beside the file.
  - **Codex (PDF)** — the same world bible as a single PDF with the images drawn into the document.

  Any formats contributed by installed [extensions](24-extensions.md) appear below the built-in ones in the same drop-down.
- **Preset** — a layout preset that sets fonts, spacing, and margins. Built-in presets are:
  - **Default** — Georgia 12pt, 1.5 line spacing; a readable PDF/EPUB.
  - **Shunn Manuscript Format** — the industry-standard submission format: Courier 12pt, double-spaced, with the Shunn header.
  - **Ebook Flow** — tighter spacing for digital reading: Georgia 11pt, 1.4 line spacing, narrower margins.
  - **Normseiten** — German standard pages: Courier New 12pt, 60 characters per line, 30 lines per page. **DOCX only** — the other formats ignore it.

  A short description of the selected preset is shown beneath the drop-down. Extensions can contribute additional presets.
- **Shunn Manuscript Format** — for **DOCX** and **PDF** only, a toggle that switches the export straight to the Shunn submission preset (and disables the Preset drop-down while it is on).
- **Title** — the title of the exported document. Defaults to the project's name.
- **Author** — author name printed on the title page and in document metadata.
- **Title page** — toggle. Include or omit a generated title page.
- **Chapter selection** — a checkbox per chapter, with **Select All** and **Select None** buttons and a running "*n* of *m*" count. All chapters are included by default; untick chapters to exclude them. This list is hidden for the **Codex** formats and for extension-contributed formats.
- **Codex entry selection** — for the two **Codex** formats the chapter list is replaced by a checkbox per codex entry, grouped by Characters, Locations, Items, and Lore and sorted by name inside each group, exactly as the exported file is ordered. Everything is ticked by default; untick the entries you do not want in the file — for example, to send a collaborator only the characters they are writing.
  - A **search box** above the list filters entries by name as you type.
  - **Select All** and **Select None** apply to the entries currently shown, so you can search for a group of entries and tick or untick them in one click without disturbing the rest of your selection.
  - The "*n* of *m*" count below the list always reports your whole selection, not just the filtered part.

Click **Export**. The system file save dialog asks where to save; pick a location and filename (the extension is pre-filled to match the format). The button shows "Exporting…" while the job runs and a result line reports success or failure.

## Built-in format details

### EPUB

- Includes chapter breaks, scene breaks, paragraph styles.
- Embeds the book's cover image, if one is set.
- Compatible with major e-readers (Kindle via conversion, Apple Books, Kobo, etc.).

### DOCX

- Standard Word document with paragraph styles mapped to Word styles:
  - Heading 1 — chapter title.
  - Heading 2 — scene title (if rendered).
  - Body Text — paragraph.
  - Quote — blockquote.
- Comments are dropped.
- Footnotes preserved as Word footnotes.

#### Normseiten (DOCX)

Selecting the **Normseiten** preset switches DOCX to the German standard-page layout, which German agents and publishers ask for by name. Rather than letting Word reflow the text, Novalist lays it out on a fixed grid so the page count in the document is exact and countable:

- Courier New 12pt with exactly 20pt line spacing.
- A4, with 3.0 cm top, 4.5 cm bottom, 2.5 cm left, and 3.2 cm right margins.
- Every line hard-wrapped at 60 characters — words are never split, so an over-long word takes a line of its own.
- A page break forced every 30 lines.
- A running header with the title and "Seite *x* von *y*".

Because pagination comes from the grid, chapters do not start on a fresh page: chapter titles appear as upper-case headings in the flow, with a blank line above and below, and scenes are separated by a centred `* * *`. Bold and italic are dropped — a Normseite is monospace plain text by definition.

To write and export a pitch document in the same layout, see [Exposé](32-expose.md).

### PDF

- Print-ready PDF with the book's cover image embedded if set.

### Markdown

- Single `.md` file. Chapter headings at H1, scenes at H2 (if titled). Footnotes preserved as markdown footnotes.

### Final Draft

- `.fdx` screenplay format. Useful for projects that double as scripts.

### LaTeX

- `.tex` source you can compile with `pdflatex` or `xelatex`. Includes a basic preamble suitable for novels.

### Codex Markdown

- A `.md` world bible of your codex entries (characters, locations, items, lore) — fields, custom properties, relationships, and section text, with entries sorted by name inside each group.
- Group headings and fixed field labels (Role, Age, Type, Relationships, …) are written in your interface language. Your own custom property names are used exactly as you typed them.
- Characters whose age is set as a birth date omit the Age line, which would otherwise just repeat the date.
- Entry images are copied into a `<filename>_images` folder next to the file and linked from the Markdown. The folder is not created when none of the exported entries has an image.
- Useful when the recipient wants to edit the text, or feed it into another tool.

### Codex PDF

- The same world bible as a single, self-contained PDF: entry images are drawn into the document, so there is no sidecar folder and nothing to lose when the file is forwarded.
- Every entry starts on its own page, so a printed copy can be handed out or filed entry by entry. Images are scaled to fit within three inches.
- **PDF bookmarks** — the reader's outline pane lists Characters, Locations, Items, and Lore, with every entry nested under its group, so you can jump straight to a character in any PDF reader.
- Section text keeps its shape: line breaks, blank lines, `#` headings, `*` bullet lists, and `**bold**` spans are laid out as formatted text rather than printed as raw markers.
- Labels and the birth-date rule work the same as in the Markdown export above.
- A title page is included when the **Title page** toggle is on.
- Images Novalist cannot read are skipped rather than failing the export.
- Useful for handing a finished reference document to a collaborator, cover artist, or editor.

## Selecting chapters

Use cases for partial exports:

- A single chapter to send to a critique partner.
- The first three chapters as a submission packet.
- Only chapters at Final status, to publish a polished excerpt.

For chapter-based formats the list shows all chapters regardless of status — you pick what you want via the checkboxes, or use **Select All** / **Select None**. The Codex formats swap this list for the codex entry picker, and extension formats export the whole project and hide the list entirely.

## Tips

- **Export EPUB and DOCX before sharing.** EPUB for reading, DOCX for tracked-changes editing.
- **Embed a cover image.** EPUB readers display the cover prominently; a missing cover signals "amateur".
- **Re-export every release.** Re-run the export for any new beta reader instead of sending an old file — it's the only way to be sure they see the latest revisions.

## Where to go next

- [Exposé](32-expose.md) — write the pitch document with live Normseiten counts, and export it in the same layout.
- [Settings](23-settings.md) — editor and appearance settings.
- [Manuscript view](10-manuscript.md) — read the whole book before you export it.
